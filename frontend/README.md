  - Resources: Official React Docs, freeCodeCamp tutorials.

## Phase 2: State Management

- **React Redux**
  - Learn Redux for global state management.
  - Understand actions, reducers, and the store.
  - Practice integrating Redux with a React app (e.g., shopping cart).
  - Resources: Redux Docs, Redux Toolkit.
- **Zustand**
  - Explore Zustand as a lightweight state management alternative.
  - Learn its simple API for managing state without boilerplate.
  - Compare with Redux in a small project.
  - Resources: Zustand GitHub, YouTube tutorials.

## Phase 3: Form Handling

- **React Hook Forms**
  - Learn to manage forms efficiently with React Hook Forms.
  - Understand form validation, error handling, and integration with UI libraries.
  - Build a complex form (e.g., multi-step form) to practice.
  - Resources: React Hook Forms Docs, Egghead.io courses.

## Phase 4: Routing

- **React Router**
  - Master client-side routing with React Router.
  - Learn dynamic routing, nested routes, and route protection.
  - Build a multi-page app (e.g., blog or dashboard) to practice.
  - Resources: React Router Docs, React Training.
- **Tanstack Router**
  - Explore Tanstack Router for type-safe routing.
  - Understand its benefits over React Router for large apps.
  - Refactor a React Router project to use Tanstack Router.
  - Resources: Tanstack Router Docs, blog posts.

## Phase 5: Data Fetching

- **Tanstack Query**
  - Learn Tanstack Query for server-state management.
  - Understand queries, mutations, and caching.
  - Build a data-driven app (e.g., API-powered dashboard).
  - Resources: Tanstack Query Docs, TKDodo blog.

## Phase 6: Design and Architecture

- **React Design Patterns**
  - Study common patterns like Compound Components, Render Props, and HOCs.
  - Learn to write reusable and maintainable code.
  - Refactor an existing project to apply these patterns.
  - Resources: Kent C. Dodds’ articles, Patterns.dev.
- **React Design System**
  - Understand how to create a design system for consistent UI.
  - Learn to build reusable component libraries.
  - Create a small design system with tokens and components.
  - Resources: Storybook Docs, Smashing Magazine articles.

## Phase 7: Component Documentation

- **Storybook**
  - Learn Storybook for developing and documenting UI components.
  - Set up Storybook in a React project and write stories for components.
  - Integrate with a design system or existing app.
  - Resources: Storybook Docs, Learn Storybook tutorials.

## Phase 8: Testing

- **React Testing**
  - Learn testing React components with Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Understand unit, integration, and snapshot testing.
  - Write tests for a small app or component library.
  - Resources: Testing Library Docs, Kent C. Dodds’ Testing JavaScript.

## Phase 9: Full-Stack Frameworks

- **NextJS**
  - Learn NextJS for server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
  - Build a full-stack app (e.g., e-commerce site) with NextJS.
  - Explore features like Vercel deployment and middleware.
  - Resources: NextJS Docs, NextJS by Example.
- **Remix**
  - Explore Remix for a different approach to full-stack React apps.
  - Learn its focus on web standards and progressive enhancement.
  - Build a similar app to compare with NextJS.
  - Resources: Remix Docs, Remix Run tutorials.

## Tips for Success

- **Practice Regularly**: Build small projects for each topic to reinforce learning.
- **Join Communities**: Engage with React communities on X, Discord, or Reddit for support.
- **Stay Updated**: Follow React and related library updates via newsletters or X posts.
- **Review and Refactor**: Revisit earlier projects to apply new skills and improve code quality.

This roadmap covers the TODOs in a practical order, balancing foundational skills with advanced tools. Adjust the pace based on your experience and goals. Happy learning!
